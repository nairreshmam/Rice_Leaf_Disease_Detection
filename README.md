Python, Machine Learning, Keras, CNN, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

**Overview:**

This project focuses on detecting diseases in rice leaves using deep learning. By analyzing images of rice leaves, the project aims to identify specific diseases that can impact crop health. Early detection can help farmers take timely action, ensuring better yield and crop management.

**Features:**
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations of sample images.
- Building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for disease classification.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy and loss curves.

**Project Workflow:**
- **Data Collection:** Load the dataset from the specified directory.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Resize images to 255x255 pixels.
  - Normalize pixel values.
  - Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualize sample images from each class.
  - Analyze the distribution of classes.
- **Model Training:**
  - Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow.
  - Train the model on the dataset.
- **Evaluation:**
  - Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy and loss.
  - Visualize learning curves for insights.
